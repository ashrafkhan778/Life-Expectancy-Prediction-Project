# Life-Expectancy-Prediction-Project

# Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict life expectancy using various socio-economic, health, and environmental factors. It utilizes a dataset containing multiple features relevant to life expectancy trends across different regions. The project applies various data science techniques to preprocess the data, explore relationships between features, and build predictive models.

# Project Structure
Life_Expectancy_Project.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the entire analysis and code for this project. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following key features:

Country: Name of the country

Year: The year the data was recorded

Life Expectancy: The average number of years a person is expected to live

Adult Mortality: Adult deaths per 1000 population

Infant Deaths: Infant deaths per 1000 live births

Alcohol: Alcohol consumption in liters per capita

Percentage Expenditure: Government health expenditure as a percentage of GDP

Hepatitis B: Percentage of the population immunized with Hepatitis B vaccine

GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita

Schooling: Average number of years of schooling

Other demographic, health, and economic indicators relevant to life expectancy




# Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand correlations, trends, and patterns that could influence life expectancy.


# Modeling: Applying machine learning models such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Any other relevant models to predict life expectancy

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models based on metrics such as RMSE, MAE, RÂ², etc.


Requirements
To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

jupyter
